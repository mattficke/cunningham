I forgot to take photos of my wireframes. Sorry! They were written down on sheets of paper.

I had two main wireframes.

1. Root page: Should just be a big map. Should start off with a default pin/location search to implicitly prompt users what to do without needing a written out set of instructions. I was going for a more minimal look with as little text as possible.

2. Feed page: The initial version was a map focused on the current location on the top of the page, and a sort of carousel of photos on the bottom half. This ended up not working well, so I changed to the current design of a map with the current location on the left half, and a sliding "filmstrip" of photos on the right.
