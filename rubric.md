## Project Workflow
Really nice documentation of your project. Really enjoyed reading your wireframes, user stories, and especially your readme. Might also be a great idea to add in setup instructions into your readme. Exceeds expectations.

## Technical Requirements
You met the minimum requirement of 2 models. But I think you're understanding of the material is far beyond that of just 2 model crud. You also utilized mapbox api(leaflet), used the instagram api, as well as some gems. Very impressive. I think there's definitely a bit of refactoring opportunity but overall great job! Exceeds expectations.

## Creativity / Interface
I love this app idea! Although it's borderline creepy. I think it's great. I though it was really cool to click on the reflecting pool in the map on a gloomy day, and I saw tourists by the reflecting pool on a gloomy day. It was sick! The interface is extremely intuitive and fluid. There's some more JS'y/AJAXy things we've learned now, I encourage you to play with some of that and see what you can do with this site! Exceeds expectations

## Code Quality
Code indentation looks great, modularity looks decent. But one glaring thing that I've noticed is a lack of comments in your code. I see a little bit in your JS, but almost none in your ruby. I would comment things like your `media_search` stuff or anything else that was complex in the making of your application. Future you will be happier with past you with good comments. Meets expectations

## Deployment and Functionality
You've deployed the app to heroku with a unique subdomain! Cool. Functionality seems flawless on the deployed version. Great job! exceeds expectations.

## overall
Truly fantastic job on this project. Looking forward to the next 2.
